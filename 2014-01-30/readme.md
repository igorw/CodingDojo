### Agenda ###

We'll start the year with another *bring-your-own-language* session! Code in any language you like or let somebody else show you the language he brought.

The kata will will be to programm a prime number generator as suggested by Daniel.

    primes(20) => [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19]
